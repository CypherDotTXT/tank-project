This is a practice project for godot and C#. 
This is also my first time coding a game in C# and EVER using Godot. 
So far got tank asset and followed some guidance from Game Dev Artisan's Godot Fundamentals series on Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/@GameDevArtisan 
Since this is my first time using this engine I have been using Chat GPT to bridge the gap between my current C# knowledge and Godot C# syntax, especially since GameDevAtrisan uses GDscript in his videos and I am using C#
